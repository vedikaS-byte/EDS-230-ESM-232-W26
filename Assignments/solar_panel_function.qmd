## Solar Panel Productivity

Here, we can create a reproducible workflow gathered in a single function to calculate the solar energy produced from solar production.

The energy produced by a solar panel system is given by

$$
E = A \cdot r \cdot H \cdot PR
$$

where:

-   $E$ is the energy produced (kWh),

-   $A$ is the solar panel area (m$^2$),

-   $r$ is the panel yield (dimensionless, 0–1), representing manufacturer efficiency (typically $\sim 0.2$),

-   $PR$ is the performance ratio (dimensionless, 0–1), accounting for site-specific losses (typically $\sim 0.75$),

-   $H$ is the annual average solar radiation (kWh m$^{-2}$).

The function solar_production takes two parameters: area (m$^2$) of the solar panel and the annual solar radiation (kWh m$^{-2}$). Both the panel yield (r) and performance ratio (PR) are predefined.

```{r}
# Create a solar energy yield function

# Panel yeild (r) and performance ratio (PR) are predefined 
r <- .2
PR <- .75

# This function takes: area (A)  and annual solar radiation (H)
solar_production <- function(A, H){
  
  # Establish the formula for solar production (units kWH) based on parameters
  energy_solar <- A * H * r * PR
  
  # Print the resulting energy produced
  print(
    paste(
      "The total energy produced from solar production is:",
      energy_solar, 
      "kWh."))
}

## Call the function on hypothetical values
solar_production(A = 45, H = 135)
```
